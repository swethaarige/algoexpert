/*
Understanding the problem
I am given two arrays of positive integers, one containing the speeds of riders with red shirts and
another one containing the speeds of riders with blue shirt. The number of red-shirt riders and the
number of blue-shirt riders are equal. I will also receive a third input parameter called fastest
and it is going to be a Boolean value. I am asked to write a function that is going to pair every
red-shirt rider with a blue-shirt rider to ride a tandem bicycle; and if the Boolean is true, the
function will return the total maximum speed of all tandem bicycles being ridden; otherwise it will
return the total minimum speed.
A tandem bicycle is a bicycle operated by two people. The speed of the bicycle is dictated by the rider
who pedals faster, for instance, if the speed of one rider is 5 and the speed of the other rider is 3,
then the speed of the bicycle is 5.

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è In a coding interview, I can ask the interviewer what does the minimum possible total speed mean
to eliminate ambiguity.
